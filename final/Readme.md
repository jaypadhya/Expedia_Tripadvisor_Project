# FINAL Analysis 1 - Exploratory Analysis


We divide our analysis in following parts:

**A) Quarterly Analysis** : Count bookings, deals, browsing activities and find unique relationships.

**B) Monthly Analysis** : Count bookings, deals, browsing activities and find unique relationships

**C) Weekly Analysis** : Count bookings, deals, browsing activities and find unique relationships

**D) Effective marketing channel** : Finding the most effective marketing channel over Time period

**E) Loyal/Runaway Customer Booking Pattern** : Analysing relation between ratings and Booking price paid

**F) Hotel Pricing Segmentation** : Understanding the price ranges and dissecting hotels into groups


















# A) Quarterly Analysis :

**Step 1 :**
- Reading through the CSV Datasets and understanding users booked vs Users not booked
- Using Pandas functionalities to get Quarter, Month, Day and Hour of the week when the customer booked the hotel.
- Drill down to get all data fro four quarters and perform various analysis like hotel booking counts. children and adult booking, ratings for hotels, revenues across each quarters, most effective marketing channel and deals booking.



# Conclusion:  Thus we have 50%-50% chances for converting one from browsing to booking. Let us now analyse the following points


# A) Quarterly Analysis :

**Step 2 : Further Drill down**
- User browsing/Booking per Quarter,  per Month and per Hour to analyse highly browsed /booked quarter with room searches, adult and children booking pattern

- User Booking on packages, bookings through mobile and most effective marketing channel per continent, per country to per city to understand trends



# Conclusion :
- We see that Quarter 2 has maximum Total Browsing activity and Quarter 4 has least. We will analyse the booking pattern across all 4 quarters

# Quarterly Analysis :

**Step 3 : Deeper : Drilling inside Quarters for more information**
- Drill down to find monthly representation of revenues and find month with highest revenues and lowest revenues
- Drill down to find week days with highest revenues and lowest revenues across all 4 quarters to find best day to book




# Conclusion :
- We see that Quarter 2 has maximum Adult booking rooms with highest bookins  and Quarter 4 has least bookings.
- Clearly we can understand that **less browsing is lesser booking** as Quarter 4 had least browsing

# Quarterly Analysis :

**Step 4 : Deeper : Drilling inside months and Days to find highest revenue grossed**
- Drill down to find monthly representation of revenues and find month with highest revenues and lowest revenues
- Drill down to find week days with highest revenues and lowest revenues across all 4 quarters to find best day to book








- We can see that we can divide the Quarters to corresponding box plots to derive meaninful relationships between them

# B) Monthly Analysis :

**Steps :**
- Reading through the CSV Datasets and understanding users booked vs Users not booked
- Drill down to get all data fro four quarters and perform various analysis like hotel booking counts. children and adult booking, ratings for hotels, revenues across each quarters, most effective marketing channel and deals booking.

- Using Cufflings, Matploblib inline and Iplots we can make an interactive plots offline and can zoom in, zoom out, select axis , deselect axis and even scroll across a huge graph to get more indepth details  



 

# Conclusion : Thus we can conclude that March had most number of unbooked hotels with December as most booked ones 

# C) Hourly Analysis :

**Steps :**
- Drill down to get all data from four quarters and perform groupby on Hours to analyse like hotel booking counts. children and adult booking, ratings for hotels, revenues across each quarters, most effective marketing channel and deals booking.





# D) **Effective marketing channel** : Finding the most effective marketing channel over Time period


**Analysing Effectiveness of Mobile usage, Package deal booking and most effective marketing channels across continent, country, city and find out the best times for booking**

**Steps:**
- Analyse the best performing Marketing channel for booking and plotting the same
- Analyse which marketing channels worked best in which quarters
- Compare all four quarters 





# Conclusion : Marketing channel 10 is most successful channel in all of the booking counts across the year and Channels 6,7,8 were highly ineffective as comparatively, the user bookings through these 3 channels were least

# Now we will drill down to understand marketing across 4 quarters and conclude on our observations





# Conclusion : Thus we compared Marketing channels across each quarters and understand their patterns

# E) **Loyal/Runaway Customer Booking Pattern** : Analysing relation between ratings and Booking price paid




# Conclusion : We can clearly see that if the experience for a user was better, they did not hesistate to pay more. 

# Analysis : Findind the most runway customers list and then identifying user attributes  (country, city, marketing channel, ratings, prices paid
